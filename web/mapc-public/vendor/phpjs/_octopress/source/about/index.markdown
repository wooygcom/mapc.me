php.js is a resource that offers community-built JavaScript alternatives to PHP functions.

**Why on earth would you port php to js?**

 - to see if we can
 - to learn JavaScript
 - to help others learn JavaScript
 - to see how php scripts perform with V8 strapped on their backs
 - to profit from helpful functions like:
[strip_tags](http://phpjs.org/functions/strip_tags/),
[strtotime](http://phpjs.org/functions/strtotime/),
[md5](http://phpjs.org/functions/md5/),
[strftime](http://phpjs.org/functions/strftime/),
[number_format](http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format/),
[wordwrap](http://phpjs.org/functions/wordwrap/), 
[vsprintf](http://phpjs.org/functions/vsprintf/), and
[date](http://phpjs.org/functions/date/), that are too high-level for JavaScript.

PHP is a language with many high-level functions and while they're not always 
implemented as consistently as we'd like (mimicking their underlying C parts), 
they do get many programming jobs done without the need for additional libraries
or abstraction. 

We recognize JS has beautiful language features, and we encourage you to learn them
(never let php.js be an excuse not to!).

That said, we do think it's a challenge to port everything and decided to also port 
low-level PHP functions like
[strpos](http://phpjs.org/functions/strpos/)
that have perfectly good (and more performant!) JavaScript 
counterparts like [String.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf).

Besides the geeky-challenge of seeing how far we can come, porting ALL THE THINGS also 
opens up php.js to other fun experiments such as realtime in-browser debugging/running of
PHP code, or running `.php` files with JavaScript engines such as V8.

This also means it's not our job to fix php's mistakes, but to mimic it as good as we can.

In doing that, php.js also becamse a reference for PHP developers wanting to see how 
something can be done in JavaScript.

php.js won't be able to fully mimic all of php on all platforms because some platforms do not preserve ordering in objects. Rightfully because it's not part of ECMA. This is a case where we accept defeat.

And so we see ourselves as this big resource and leave it up to the developer 
to decide what makes sense to take from it.

And what not.

Going by [The McDonald's Theory](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d) 
we have plently of functions online that aren't perfect just yet.
If you know better ways, just send us a pull request : )
