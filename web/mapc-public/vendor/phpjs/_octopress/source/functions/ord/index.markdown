  //  discuss at: http://phpjs.org/functions/ord/
  // original by: Kevin van Zonneveld (http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net)
  // bugfixed by: Onno Marsman
  // improved by: Brett Zamir (http://brett-zamir.me)
  //    input by: incidence
  //   example 1: ord('K');
  //   returns 1: 75
  //   example 2: ord('\uD800\uDC00'); // surrogate pair to create a single Unicode character
  //   returns 2: 65536

      return code; // This is just a high surrogate with no following low surrogate, so we return its value;
      // we could also throw an error as it is not a complete character, but someone may want to know

Please note that php.js uses JavaScript objects as substitutes for PHP arrays, they are 
the closest match to this hashtable-like data structure. 

Please also note that php.js offers community built functions and goes by the 
[McDonald's Theory](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/9216e1c9da7d). We'll put online 
functions that are far from perfect, in the hopes to spark better contributions. 
Do you have one? Then please just:
